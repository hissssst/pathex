Negative indexes, lens fixes, force_update nil filling and refactoring

**Breaking**

* matching force_update fix. Now it doesn't raise an error when called
* filtering force_update fix. Now it doesn't raise an error when called
* Tuple force_update fix. Now it works with indexes and for `force_set {}, path(2), 1` it will create `{nil, nil, 1}`.

**Non-breaking**

* Tuple negative index is now supported for all operations
* List negative indexes now work the same way as positive indexes (but backwards), except `-1` which still prepends to the list.
