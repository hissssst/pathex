# Pathex

Speed or composability? Choose both!

### What is Pathex?

Pathex is a library for performing fast actions with nested data structures in Elixir.
With pathex you can trivially set, get and update values in structures in a functional manner.
It provides all necessary logic to manipulate data structures in different ways using flexible __functional lens__ pattern.

### Why another library?

Existing methods of accesssing data in nested structures are either slow (like `Focus`) or do not provide enough functionality (like `Access`). For example setting the value in structure with Pathex is `70-160x` faster than `Focus` or `2-3x` faster than `put_in` and `get_in`

## Usage

Pathex is really simple and straightforward to use (almost like `Enum`). You don't need to learn any specific language, just create paths with `path` and use verbs with them.

### Add it to your module

```elixir
# This will import path macro and operators and require Pathex
use Pathex
```

> Or just `import Pathex`

### Create the path

```elixir
path_to_streets = path :user / :private / :addresses / 0 / :street
path_in_json = path "users" / 1 / "street", :json
```

This creates closure which can get, set, update and delete values in this path

### Use the path

```elixir
{:ok, "6th avenue" = street} =
  %{
    user: %{
      id: 1,
      name: "hissssst",
      private: %{
        phone: "123-456-789",
        addresses: [
           [city: "City", street: "6th avenue", mail_index: 123456]
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  |> Pathex.view(path_to_streets)

%{
  "users" => %{
    1 => %{"street" => "6th avenue"}
  }
} = Pathex.force_set!(%{}, path_in_json, street)
```

## Features

Pathex has a lot of different features and can even compete with code written by hand in terms of efficiency.
Pathex significantly reduces the time to write a code which manipulates nested structure, while
providing efficiency and composability. No more functions like `get_users`, `set_users`, `update_users`! No more XPaths, JSONPaths, CSS Selectors!

### Easy to use

It's not harder to use than `Map` or `Enum`! Check out the [cheatsheet](https://hexdocs.pm/pathex/cheatsheet.html) for common tasks.

Pathex also provides more information about errors than any other tool.

```elixir
iex(1)> field = :email
iex(2)> Pathex.view!(%{}, path(:users) ~> all() ~> path(:personal / field))
** (Pathex.Error)
  Couldn't find element

    Path:      path(:users) ~> all() ~> path(:personal / :email)

    Structure: %{}
```

### Fast

Paths are just a set of pattern-matching cases.
This is done to extract maximum efficiency from BEAM's pattern-matching compiler.

```elixir
# Code for viewing variables for path
path(1 / "y", :map)

# Almost equals to
case input do
  %{1 => %{"y" => res}} ->
    {:ok, res}

  _ ->
    :error
end
```

### Reusable

One path can be used to update, get, set, delete or update a value in the structure!
And these paths can even be composed together.
This composition is very efficient, there's no need to concatenate lists like `Access` does.

```elixir
# User structure
user = %User{
  personal: %{fname: "Kabs", sname: "Rocks"},
  phone: "123-456-789"
}

# Path to username in user structure
username = path(:personal / :fname)

# Get a username
{:ok, "Kabs"} = Pathex.view(user, username)

# Set a username
another_user =
  %User{
    personal: %{fname: "Blabs", sname: "Rocks"},
    phone: "123-456-789"
  } = Pathex.set!(user, username, "Blabs")

# Get all usernames!
import Pathex.Lenses
["Kabs", "Blabs"] =
  [
    user,
    another_user
  ]
  |> Pathex.view!(all() ~> username)
```

Pathex can be used to manipulate different nested data structures. From `GenServer` state to HTML or Elixir's AST!

### Extensible

Pathex is built around simple primitive called `path-closure`, which is a simple closure with clearly defined specification. Anything complying with `Pathex.t()` spec can be used within `Pathex`.


## Installation
